# Calculator

This is my calculator project made with vanilla js, html and css. 
The calculator has the basic calculator functions (+ - * /) and follows left to right order of operations.
For example, if you type in 5 + 3 * 6, the result will be 48 and not 23.


Nice to haves that may be implemented in the future:
- keyboard support
- backspace button
